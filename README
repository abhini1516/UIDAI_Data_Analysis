## 📁 Project Structure

- `scripts/` : Python scripts for data processing and analysis.  
- `outputs/` : Folder to store processed outputs (tracked in Git).

## ⚠️ Important Note on Datasets

The **raw datasets are not included** in this repository due to privacy and security concerns.  

Only registered hackathon participants can access the datasets from the official portal:

**Pipeline Description:**

1. **Raw Datasets:** Input datasets are obtained through hackathon registration.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Scripts handle missing values, formatting, and basic validation.
3. **Data Transformation & Feature Engineering:** Transform raw data into analysis-ready format.
4. **Analysis & Visualization Scripts:** Generate graphs, tables, and statistical summaries.
5. **Processed Outputs:** All outputs are saved in the `outputs/` folder for review.
6. **Insights & Reports:** Optional stage for generating final reports or presentations.
